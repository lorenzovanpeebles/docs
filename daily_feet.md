## **Updated Comprehensive Right Leg Rehab Plan with MOBO Board**

### **Daily MOBO Board Routine (5-10 min, 3-4x/week)**

Do these **barefoot** for maximum proprioceptive feedback:

**Week 1-2: Foundation Exercises**

1. **Foot Rocks** (Start here)

- Fins in EVEN slots: Rock toe side down, then heel side down (controlled, like touching eggshells). 30 reps
- Switch fins to ODD slots: 30 more reps
- Flip board for left foot, repeat sequence
- *Focus: Drive through big toe to control the motion*

1. **Everted Pass Around**

- Fins in OUTSIDE slots (3+4) - board stays stationary, outer foot elevated
- Hold kettlebell or water jug, pass hand to hand for 2 min each foot
- *This trains safer ankle position and fights your compensation pattern*

**Week 3+: Progressive Exercises**

1. **Single-leg Balance on MOBO**

- Even slots, maintain level board for 30-60 sec
- Progress: Add arm movements, ball toss against wall

1. **Banded Twist**

- Stand on MOBO with resistance band, press arms forward, rotate torso while keeping board level
- Drive big toe down to keep board stable, 25 reps each foot

1. **Tippy Bird (Single-leg RDL on MOBO)**

- Hip hinge motion while maintaining stable spine on unstable board
- Integrates foot-hip connection

### **Updated Daily Schedule**

**Morning (10 min):**

- Ankle circles, alphabet draws
- Calf/soleus stretches (3 min each)
- Hip flexor stretch (3 min right side emphasis)

**Midday (10 min):**

- MOBO Board routine (alternate exercises daily)
- Ice massage if needed

**Evening Strength Circuit (15-20 min):**

*Right leg emphasis on all exercises*

1. **Resistance band dorsiflexion** - 3×15
1. **Resistance band eversion** - 3×15
1. **Glute activation circuit:**

- Clamshells - 3×20
- Monster walks - 3×10 each direction
- Single-leg bridges - 3×12 (right leg focus)

1. **Heel walks** - 3×30 seconds
1. **Eccentric calf raises** - 3×10

**Before Bed:**

- Foam roll: Right calf, TFL, quad (2 min each)
- Loaded ankle mobilization with band - 2×15 right side
- Final hip flexor/quad stretch

### **Key MOBO Board Principles:**

- Start 5-10 minutes, 3x/week to avoid fatigue - quality over quantity
- Train barefoot for proprioceptive feedback - helps brain connect with foot muscles
- Requires mental focus - about precision control, not speed
- The hollow box forces your big toe to work (addressing your inactive arch/toe issue)
- Progress by adding weight, resistance band, or complexity, not more reps

### **Timeline Expectations:**

- **Weeks 1-2**: Focus on ankle mobility and MOBO basics
- **Weeks 3-4**: Add MOBO progressions, should see dorsiflexion improving
- **Weeks 6-8**: Right ankle dorsiflexion should match left, glute activation improving
- **3-6 months**: Full tendinosis remodeling, normalized movement patterns

The MOBO Board directly addresses your root issue - it’ll retrain that right foot/ankle to activate properly, which should resolve the compensation chain all the way up to your IT band.
