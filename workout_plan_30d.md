# 30-Day Scapula Recovery & Athletic Maintenance Plan - REVISED

## Overview
This plan balances scapula recovery (fractured Oct 28) with maintaining high-level athleticism through cardio, strength, mobility, and specialized foot/ankle work. All exercises respect current limitations: no heavy weights, no overhead loading, modified push-ups. Strength already ramped beyond beginner level.

## Key Principles & Modifications

### Scapula Protection (Ongoing)
- No overhead pressing movements
- Push-ups modified (on knees, limited depth)
- Focus on rowing/pulling movements (banded work excellent)
- Monitor for any clicking, grinding, or pain
- Farmers carries test shoulder stability with weight tight to body

### Progressive Overload Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2:** Establish baseline with 3 Leg Blaster rounds
- **Weeks 3-4:** Progress to 4 Leg Blaster rounds
- Strength work progresses from bodyweight → light → moderate weights
- Never sacrifice form for weight

### Back Care (Critical for Disc Health)
- Morning and evening routines are NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Vibrating foam rolling twice daily helps maintain mobility
- If back tightens: add cat-cow, child's pose, gentle spinal twists
- Prioritize sleep on YOUR mattress
- Glute/core work protects spine during all activities

### Foot/Ankle/Knee Care
- MOBO board twice daily prevents knee flare-ups
- Start with EVEN fin slots, progress to ODD as strength improves
- Ankle strengthening prevents ITBS and patellar issues
- IT band rolling is ESSENTIAL before and after runs
- Single-leg work addresses imbalances

### Hamstring & Glute Emphasis
- Every strength day includes dedicated posterior chain work
- Nordic curls, RDLs, hip thrusts build eccentric strength for skiing
- Single-leg work addresses imbalances
- Banded work constant throughout for glute activation

### Ruck Progression
- Test without weight Days 1-4
- 10 lbs Days 5-9 if comfortable
- 15 lbs Days 10-16
- 20 lbs Days 17-23
- 25 lbs Days 24-30 (if scapula tolerates)
- **Ruck must stay TIGHT against back** - any shifting stops immediately

### Peloton Integration
- All bike rides on stationary Peloton (Chicago winter)
- Instructors mentioned are suggestions, choose your favorites
- 5-10 min core classes supplement evening floor work
- Power Zone rides build cycling-specific endurance
- Climb rides simulate mountain training

### General Guidelines
- **Pain rule:** Discomfort acceptable, sharp pain is NOT
- **Sleep:** 7-8 hours non-negotiable for recovery
- **Hydration:** Essential for disc health and performance
- **Listen to PT:** Tuesdays & Thursdays provide weekly feedback
- **Family involvement:** Trail runs, walks, yoga keep it fun and sustainable

### Weather/Schedule Flexibility
- Peloton rides flexible by day (all indoor anyway)
- Trail runs can swap with Peloton days if weather/time requires
- Yoga can be home practice if class unavailable
- Strength sessions can compress to 40 min if needed (keep Leg Blasters)
- Evening routine is MOST important for injury prevention

## Equipment Needed

**Home Equipment:**
- MOBO board (you have)
- Resistance bands (light, medium, heavy)

- Variable terrain near major city

---

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Assessments
- **Shoulder:** ROM checks with PT (Tues/Thurs)
- **Back tightness:** Should decrease over month
- **Ruck weight:** Progressive loading without pain
- **Leg Blasters:** Aim for unbroken sets by Week 4
- **MOBO board:** Progress from EVEN to ODD slots, add weight

### Monthly Goals
- Complete 4 unbroken Full Leg Blasters
- Ruck comfortably with 25 lbs
- Trail run 60-70 minutes without knee pain
- Maintain shoulder healing trajectory
- No back spasms (mobility work prevents this)
- Feel confident skiing difficult terrain

### Performance Indicators
- Energy and sleep quality
- Hamstring/glute strength in ski-specific movements
- Ankle stability on uneven terrain
- Core strength and endurance
- Overall athleticism maintained

---

## Notes for Next Month

After completing this month, you'll be ready to:
- Progress to heavier overhead work (if PT clears)
- Increase Leg Blaster volume (5-6 rounds)
- Add plyometric complexity
- Increase ruck weight for longer durations
- Return to climbing gym (if shoulder ready)
- Prepare specifically for ski season

**You're not just recovering - you're maintaining elite fitness while healing.** This plan keeps you strong, mobile, and ready to ski insane terrain with your kids while respecting the scapula healing timeline. The leg blasters will have you ready for steep descents, the MOBO work protects your knee, and the daily mobility prevents back issues.

**Stay consistent with the morning and evening routines - they're your insurance policy against injury.**
